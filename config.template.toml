#   cp config.template.toml config.toml
#   # Edit config.toml with your directories
#   ./backup.sh --dry-run

[remote]
# rclone remote name — must match what you created during setup
# For encrypted backups:  name = "gdrive-crypt"   (run ./setup.sh and enable encryption)
# For unencrypted backups: name = "gdrive"
name = "gdrive"

# Root folder on Google Drive where all backups are stored
# This works the same whether using encrypted or unencrypted remotes
root = "backups"

[versions]
# How many previous versions to keep for modified files
keep_changed = 5

# How many previous versions to keep for deleted files
keep_deleted = 10
